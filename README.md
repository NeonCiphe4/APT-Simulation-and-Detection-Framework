# Advanced Persistent Threat Simulation & Detection Framework 

## Repository Purpose

This repository hosts the final project report and supporting files for the framework. It serves as a structured record of an end-to-end APT simulation executed in a controlled environment, aligned with red team methodology and detection engineering objectives.

All technical details, configurations, MITRE mappings, and operational logs are included in the report itself.
